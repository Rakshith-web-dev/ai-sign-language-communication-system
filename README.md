# AI Sign Language Communication System

A real-time AI system that converts **sign language gestures into text and speech** using computer vision and machine learning.

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between **deaf and hearing individuals** by enabling real-time sign language recognition using a webcam.

---

## Project Overview

The system detects hand gestures using **MediaPipe and OpenCV**, classifies the gesture using **machine learning**, and converts the recognized sign into **text and speech output**.

---

## Features

- Real-time hand landmark detection
- Sign language gesture recognition
- Gesture to text conversion
- Text to speech output
- Webcam-based interaction

---

## Tech Stack

**Programming Language**
- Python

**Libraries & Frameworks**
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- NumPy
